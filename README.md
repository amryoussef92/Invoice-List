# interview-task

This is the repository for the **interview-task** project, which includes both the frontend (built with React) and backend (Node.js/Express). Below are the setup instructions and available scripts for running and building the application.

## Getting Started with Create React App (Frontend)

The frontend was bootstrapped using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts

In the frontend directory, you can run:

- **`npm start`**: Runs the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view in your browser.
- **`npm test`**: Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.
- **`npm run build`**: Builds the app for production in the `build` folder.
- **`npm run eject`**: Ejects the app for full control of the configuration (not reversible).

For more detailed instructions, refer to the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).

### Deployment

For deployment information, visit [this guide](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment).

## Backend

The backend consists of a Node.js/Express API. To set it up:

1. Navigate to the backend directory.
2. Install the dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Start the backend server by running `npm start`.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into two main directories:

1. **frontend**: Contains the React.js application.
2. **backend**: Contains the API server for handling requests and data storage.
